## Introduction

{{< lipsum 1 >}}


## Different kinds of text

This sentence contains some _italicised text_, some **bold text**, some text that is **_both bold and italic_**, some `monospace text`, and finally some [linked text](https://github.com/ukceh-rse/brand-yml).

Quarto supports extended markdown syntax including superscript^2^, subscript~2~ and ~~strikethrough~~.

## Headings

### Heading 3 (h3)

#### Heading 4 (h4)

##### Heading 5 (h5)

###### Heading 6 (h6)

Here we see the different levels of heading, from h2 down to h6.

You can create interal links to headings. For example, the following links to the [Introduction section](#introduction).

## Lists

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
   a. Sub-item a
   b. Sub-item b

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task

## Code

Now we have some inline code `print("hello there")`{.python} and a code block

```python
import math

radius = 1.0
area = math.pi * radius**2
```

## Maths

Here is some inline math: $y = mx + c$.

Here is some display math:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$
